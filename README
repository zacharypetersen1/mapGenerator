This script takes an 'input image' and also a 'template file' as input
Then generates a textured background image

each pixel on the 'input image' represents a square pattern on the output image
The template determines which pixels map to which pattern based on color values

usage: python MapGenerator <inputFileName> <outputFileName> <templateFileName> <patternSize>
do not add .png extension to output file name, script will do this automatically
exit conditions: 0 = fine, 1 = illegal arguments, 2 = file not found (from args), 3 = read error/file not found (from template file)
